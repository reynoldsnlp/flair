Concerning the BING_API environment variable:
Any standard tutorial for creating a new environment variable should suffice.
However, when an IDE is employed (such as IntelliJ IDEA), one must ensure that the
environment variable is still accessible from within the IDE. For IntelliJ IDEA on
Windows 10, we have noticed that there are some difficulties. It seems that the IDE
has difficulties integrating the environment variables. We have discovered that
even restarting the IDE is insufficient; rather, a full system reboot was needed.
When the whole computer was restarted and the IDE again opened, then the environment
variable was accessible through the IDE.
